# livedata-room-databinding

> #### Below are the concepts covered in this code, ####
* LiveData -  https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata
* Room Persistence Library - https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room
* Databinding - https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/


> For demonstration purpose, I have created an app for saving my small notes which I can read at any time.
So here the user can add new notes and read them any time.
* To store the data I have used  Room Persistence Library (insert and fetch operations are covered).
* To get the data, I have used Livedata, Which also helps when there is any change in the data source.
* To bind the data in XML files, I have used data binding.
